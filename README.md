## Standing up local docs for development purposes

1. Run the make recipe to build and start a local mkdocs docker

    ```bash
    make dev-docs
    ```

2. Go to `localhost:8000` in a browser of your choice to view the docs. Any changes to the `docs` directory will cause a live reload to the browser display.
